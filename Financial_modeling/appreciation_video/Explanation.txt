This is an appreciation video of simulated G-coin values. Those values simulate how G-coin could have grown in those years. We would not have exact data for last few months of 2022 of G-coin values, therefore we preferred G-coin as simulated in our financial paper. We believe simulations show better picture in that case anyway, because we can better manipulate the construction of the index as it will actually be in the future. In this way we can better represent past data in a way that is more relevant today.
