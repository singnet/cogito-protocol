Cogito protocol

Here is the Cogito's codebase.
At financial modeling folder, we have a financial model (set up for Monte Carlo simulations), index simulation and growth modeling samples.


Instructions to make a sample simulation in financial model:
Head to Financial_modeling/financial_model_interactive/simulate_growth.ipynb . There one can run the whole code and get a sample result. Each result will be different due to the fact that it is randomly generated.

Exact MC simulation is not here due to the sheer size of the files and complications (such as memory and processing limitations) of making them. We can supply those information per request. In general there could be additional files working if they are specific to simulation and can be gathered per request.
