What is Cogito?

Cogito is the first protocol to offer low-to-medium risk asset classes or "tracercoins" on blockchain. Cogito is open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain â€“ currently implemented on Cardano (with possible cross chain implementations in the future). The end goal of the Cogito Protocol is to fill in the gap of assets in crypto, like treasury bills, corporate bonds, and real estate in traditional finance world. 

Cogito shares merchanism and design with stablecoins. It brings together familiar concepts into a never before seen protocol:

Index creation - Cogito creates synthetic indexes, i.e. Green Index and Singularity Index, using data from World Bank, OECD, United Nations, Nasdaq etc. We run regression on the data and smooth it for a stable and reliable output 

Fractional-Algorithmic â€“ the supply of tracercoins are partly backed by collateral and partly algorithmic. The ratio of collateralized and algorithmic depends on the market's pricing of the tracercoins. If tracercoins are trading at above $1, the protocol decreases the collateral ratio. If FRAX is trading at under $1, the protocol increases the collateral ratio.

Deposit and earn - users can deposit their tracercoins with the deposit protocol and enjoy a floating yield depending on their tenor, and subject to market enviornment.

Investment protocol - reserve management

Stablization pool/Swap-based Monetary Policy â€“ Cogito uses principles from automated market makers like Uniswap to create swap-based price discovery and real-time stabilization incentives through arbitrage.

Oracles - we use proprietory data for oracles

Decentralized & Governance-minimized â€“ Community governed and emphasizing a highly autonomous, algorithmic approach with no active management.

Three Tokens â€“ GCOIN is the semi-stablecoin targeting a tight band around green index. XCOIN is the tech coin targeting a less rigorous peg to singularity index. Cogito Governance Token (CGV) is the governance token which accrues fees, seigniorage revenue, and excess collateral value.
